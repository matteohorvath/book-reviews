# Zero to One - Peter Thiel

## The challenge of the future

Thinking independently and looking at data is important. There is no other way leaders of humanity can learn to be leaders.

## Zero to one and the future of progress

The difference between __0 to 1__ and __1 to n__ is that the first is creating a new way to do things. Making it easier to do more. this is technology. The other is scale something. We call it globalization. In the history, people lived far worse than today. 30 years ago people thought that life will be much easier today through automatization. Reality is that we have a bunch of semi-useless tools, but other needs such as attention and connectedness is way more overstressed than anyone ever thought.

## Startup thinking

That's the way to create new technology. e.g. Founding Fathers, Royal society, Fairchild Semiconductors. In they own respected industry they are all creators of ways to do more with less.

## Party like it's 1999

Read this part of history, really interesting. TLDR: second part of the 90', everybody went crazy about internet companies.

## Lessons learned

1. Make incremental changes - lower the risk, more stable pathway
2. Stay lean and flexible - idealistic in how humans work, but to be adaptive to the market is great. Over fitting might be worse than having a d/dx curve of the firm.
3. Improve on the competition - strategy to great a superior product and beat companies which are either slow or not function well.
4. Focus on product, not sales - missing the talk to users part, and the development will be completely detached from reality.

Lessons which Peter is suggesting, which he thinks are the real truth.

1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
2. A bad plan is better than no plan
3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
4. Sales matters just as much as product.

## All happy companies are different

Value creation and value capture is not the same. Airplanes <> Google.

## Lies people tell

On monopolies and competitive markets, it says that the general perception is that they are close. In reality they operate completely differently, and having a monopoly is far more advantageous for a startup. Firms with competitive markets don't make as much profit for growth as a monopoly on a smaller market. Both they are telling that they are the opposite.
Non-monopolists are trying to tell that they are on such a niche market that they are owning it. Monopolies telling that they are part of multiple huge markets, which are competitive.

## Ruthless people

Monopoly in general is not a good thing for everybody. The users are getting the product more expensive than it could be. On the other hand in a competitive space no companies have profits to develop themselves more rapidly. Monopolies are a way to have a clear growth rate, because the profits are leveling up the company's growth (if spent properly).

## Monopoly capitalism

As it was mentioned, monopoly is a bad thing in every "game" where the services and the assets are constant. Our world is dynamic and monopolies need to evolve and iterate, otherwise they stagnate and die. Economists are obsessed with the competition because that's the only thing which could be modelled through particle models of the 19th century. 

## The ideology of competition

Creative monopoly is a way to create new great products while having the profit for the creator for further creations. Competition in numbers or prizes can help to focus the human mind, but creative thinking on the other hand is not well measurable, thus you cannot win. Competition is a fake concept to stress the human to do something which otherwise wouldn't be necessary.

## War and peace

MBA student are fascinated with the metaphor that the business is like a was. Yes, it used to be when the only was to grow your grocery is to conquer new territories, like emperors did. Marx <> Shakespeare. Marx > people are fighting because they are different. Shakespeare > people are fighting because they are the same. Microsoft and Google battling while Apple became a bigger company while focusing on things that matter. What people want, and not copying the others product and start competing with them. Asperger's-like people are good not giving a damn about what other groups say. Also they can be more independent thinker which makes their efforts towards building things that matter and not caring about the competitors. Oracle <> Informix.
X <> Paypal teamed up (also fired Elon in a year).
