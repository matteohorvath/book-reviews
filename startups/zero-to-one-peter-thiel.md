# Zero to One - Peter Thiel

## The challenge of the future

Thinking independently and looking at data is important. There is no other way leaders of humanity can learn to be leaders.

### Zero to one and the future of progress

The difference between __0 to 1__ and __1 to n__ is that the first is creating a new way to do things. Making it easier to do more. this is technology. The other is scale something. We call it globalization. In the history, people lived far worse than today. 30 years ago people thought that life will be much easier today through automatization. Reality is that we have a bunch of semi-useless tools, but other needs such as attention and connectedness is way more overstressed than anyone ever thought.

### Startup thinking

That's the way to create new technology. e.g. Founding Fathers, Royal society, Fairchild Semiconductors. In they own respected industry they are all creators of ways to do more with less.

### Party like it's 1999

Read this part of history, really interesting. TLDR: second part of the 90', everybody went crazy about internet companies.

### Lessons learned

1. Make incremental changes - lower the risk, more stable pathway
2. Stay lean and flexible - idealistic in how humans work, but to be adaptive to the market is great. Over fitting might be worse than having a d/dx curve of the firm.
3. Improve on the competition - strategy to great a superior product and beat companies which are either slow or not function well.
4. Focus on product, not sales - missing the talk to users part, and the development will be completely detached from reality.

Lessons which Peter is suggesting, which he thinks are the real truth.

1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
2. A bad plan is better than no plan
3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
4. Sales matters just as much as product.

## All happy companies are different

Value creation and value capture is not the same. Airplanes <> Google.

### Lies people tell

On monopolies and competitive markets, it says that the general perception is that they are close. In reality they operate completely differently, and having a monopoly is far more advantageous for a startup. Firms with competitive markets don't make as much profit for growth as a monopoly on a smaller market. Both they are telling that they are the opposite.
Non-monopolists are trying to tell that they are on such a niche market that they are owning it. Monopolies telling that they are part of multiple huge markets, which are competitive.

### Ruthless people

Monopoly in general is not a good thing for everybody. The users are getting the product more expensive than it could be. On the other hand in a competitive space no companies have profits to develop themselves more rapidly. Monopolies are a way to have a clear growth rate, because the profits are leveling up the company's growth (if spent properly).

### Monopoly capitalism

As it was mentioned, monopoly is a bad thing in every "game" where the services and the assets are constant. Our world is dynamic and monopolies need to evolve and iterate, otherwise they stagnate and die. Economists are obsessed with the competition because that's the only thing which could be modelled through particle models of the 19th century. 

### The ideology of competition

Creative monopoly is a way to create new great products while having the profit for the creator for further creations. Competition in numbers or prizes can help to focus the human mind, but creative thinking on the other hand is not well measurable, thus you cannot win. Competition is a fake concept to stress the human to do something which otherwise wouldn't be necessary.

### War and peace

MBA student are fascinated with the metaphor that the business is like a was. Yes, it used to be when the only was to grow your grocery is to conquer new territories, like emperors did. Marx <> Shakespeare. Marx > people are fighting because they are different. Shakespeare > people are fighting because they are the same. Microsoft and Google battling while Apple became a bigger company while focusing on things that matter. What people want, and not copying the others product and start competing with them. Asperger's-like people are good not giving a damn about what other groups say. Also they can be more independent thinker which makes their efforts towards building things that matter and not caring about the competitors. Oracle <> Informix.
X <> Paypal teamed up (also fired Elon in a year).

### Last mover advantage

Discounted cash flows is the value of a company today. Meaning that a growing company's future cashflow is growing also. Most of the realized value of a startup is in 10 years or so.

### Characteristics of Monopoly

1. Proprietary technology - e.g. openai is doing it in a beautiful way today. Also each model on the market have a monopoly for certain use cases. 10x improvement is required.
2. Network effects - there is an amazing book from Andrew Chen called "cold start problem" which summarizes his experiences and stories from hyper growing companies.
3. Economies of Scale - the development of a software is kinda fixed in price, while creating another instance for selling is virtually yero cost.
4. Branding - Your brand is your monopoly. Build it and protect it. This is the last thing, and shouldn't be used as an only power of a company.

### Building a Monopoly

1. Start small and monopolize - smaller the market with more the power users the better.
2. Scaling up - acquire similar markets (eg. Amazon did after books)
3. Don't disrupt - that's like being a massive trouble maker. Don't do it just on purpose.

Last mover if also an advantage, study the endgame before.

## You are not a lottery ticket

Luck is involved in most parts of our lives. Still success and companies with huge impact is more due to the resilience and the innovations. Plans and bold head is underestimated tools.

### Can you control your future?

- Indefinite pessimism - e.g. Europe, effect is that bureaucracy takes place, everybody is pretending that they are doing great job, while nobody is believing that it will be any better
- Definite and pessimistic - e.g. China today, low trust in future, and high savings (low investments). taking the future deadly seriously
- Definite Optimism - e.g. USA 50'-70', bold plans
- Indefinite optimism - USA today, we don't know how but things will get better

### Our indefinitely optimistic world

When things are indefinite bureaucracy is coming with all forms of pretending that showing it will be better. Finance is a great example, with the newer and more complex financial services and funds. People are giving away their money to people to manage, and they are also giving to other people and so on.
In politics we choose leaders based on propaganda and few word campaigns. Actions are no more important.
In technology this method is fairly not effective. Biotech companies also work on indefinite thinking where the result from some research cannot be seen, though no plans are made to work for something specific.

### Is indefinite optimism even possible?

Progress without planning is "evolution". In startups intelligent design is more superior than darwinism.

### The return of design

Long-term planning is undervalued by our short-term world. Buying a company sucks. Either not enough (founders with definite plans) or overvalued (founders don't have new vision).
Start rejecting the tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

## Follow the money

Money makes money. Successful business people understand the power law, which says a small portion will outsize the volume of others summed.

### The power law of venture capital

A 10-year lifespan fund usually have a portfolio of companies. They want to diversify their portfolio, which usually makes it a very usual fund.

### J-curve of a successful venture fund

In the first 5 year the value is decreasing and the exponential curve is taking off after. The performance of a few companies will drive the overall valuation of the fund. If the fund is "well diversified" this probably never happen. If the fund is investing into companies which don't event have the chance to grow super big (10x), then the return of the fund will be low.

### Why people don't see the power law

The exponential curve is not seeable in the first five years. If you are not focused on it, probably it will never happen.

### What to do with the power law

The good investors are making as few investments as possible. You probably shouldn't start your own company, if you are not operating the power law great. A fast growing company will pay more than 100% of nothing. Last mover advantage

## Secrets

There are three types of truths. ONBe is the convetional which is easy to understand, one is the secret which is hard, and one is the mysteries which are impossible to understand.

### Why aren't people looking for secrets?

Interesting story about the life of the Unabomber. Goals: easily satisfiable, need hard effort, impossible. Things which needed hard effort are less common because of technological advancements.
Four thinkings risen from the transformation of everyday goals

- incrementalism- from early age we learn that learning is done via small steps and you shouldn't overachieve because you won't get more reward, this cause e.g. large numbers of common papers are more important than frontier research
- risk aversion - being wrong means lonely means death
- complacency - elite classes believe that their superiority is enough to justify to collect rents the ideas of the past
- flatness - with globalization people see the world as one homogeneous market, where nothing new can be done because of the massive size of it. Why wouldn't more talented and rich people didn't do this or that is the first question which came to mind of a new creator.

The good thing is that today it's more hard to start a cult, because people don't think that there is some mystery which can only be obtained if your are part of a sect.

### The World according to convention
